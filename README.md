# News Correlation Project

This project focuses on analyzing sentiment, topics, and reporting correlations among various global media agencies. It aims to evaluate candidates for the 12-week training program in Data Engineering (DE), Generative AI Engineering (AIE), and Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) at 10 Academy.

## Project Overview

The project involves working with a Global News Dataset comprising news articles collected over the past few months using the NewsAPI. The dataset includes information such as article content, source, author, publication date, and sentiment analysis.

The project is divided into five tasks:

1. **Git and GitHub, Project Planning, EDA & Stats**
2. **Data Science Component Building**
3. **PostgreSQL**
4. **Dashboards**
5. **Deployment**

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/news_correlation_10ac_week0.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Obtain the dataset files (`data.csv` and `domains_location.csv`) and place them in the appropriate directories.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Git and GitHub, Project Planning, EDA & Stats

- Understand the CRISP-DM framework
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical analysis

### Task 2: Data Science Component Building

- Understand MLOps components
- Design analysis pipelines
- Perform time series analysis
- Classify headlines into predefined tags
- Conduct topic modeling and sentiment analysis
- Develop predictive models and network analysis

### Task 3: PostgreSQL

- Learn about database technologies (SQL vs NoSQL)
- Design a database schema
- Use PostgreSQL as a feature store
- Load data into PostgreSQL

### Task 4: Dashboards

- Design a Streamlit-based dashboard
- Understand React and Python for full-stack development
- Build a simple React app or Streamlit component

### Task 5: Deployment

- Deploy the Streamlit or React app
- Implement GitHub Actions for continuous deployment (CD)
- Set up a PostgreSQL database
- Understand deployment technologies (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)
